## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Create Your First App
```bash
flutter create my_first_app
cd my_first_app
flutter run
```

### 2. Key Concepts to Understand

**Everything is a Widget:**
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Text('Hello, Flutter Dev!'),
    );
  }
}
```

**Hot Reload:**
- Save your file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)
- See changes instantly in your app!

**Widget Tree:**
```
MaterialApp
└── Scaffold
    └── AppBar
    └── Body
        └── Column
            ├── Text
            └── Button
```

## 💡 Learning Tips

### For Beginners:
1. **Start Small:** Don't try to build complex apps immediately
2. **Experiment:** Change colors, text, and see what happens
3. **Use Hot Reload:** It's Flutter's superpower!
4. **Read Error Messages:** They're usually helpful
5. **Practice Daily:** Even 30 minutes makes a difference

### Debugging Tips:
```dart
// Use print statements to debug
print('Debug: Button pressed');

// Use debugPrint for better console output
debugPrint('Value of counter: $counter');

// Use assert for development-time checks
assert(counter >= 0, 'Counter should not be negative');
```

## 🛠️ Common Commands

```bash
# Create new Flutter project
flutter create project_name

# Run the app
flutter run

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d device_id

# Get list of connected devices
flutter devices

# Check for issues
flutter doctor

# Clean build files
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Upgrade Flutter
flutter upgrade
```
